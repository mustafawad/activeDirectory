How to move Windows DNS zones to another Windows server:

- Windows DNS Server service must be installed on a new Windows Server. The DNS Server service should not be configured yet.

1- On the DNS server that is currently hosting the DNS zone(s), change any Active Directory-integrated zones to standard primary. This action creates the zone files that are needed for the destination DNS server.

2- Stop the DNS Server service on both DNS servers.

3- Manually copy the entire contents (subfolders included) of the %SystemRoot%\System32\DNS folder from the source server to the destination server.

( Recommended:  back up the registry before you modify it)

4- On the current DNS server, start Registry Editor (Regedit.exe).

5- Locate and click the following registry subkey:

HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\DNS\Zones

6- Export the Zones entry to a registry file.

7- Locate and click the following registry subkey:

HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\DNS Server\Zones

8- Export the Zones entry to a registry file.

9- On the destination DNS server, double-click each registry file to import the Zones subkeys into the registry.

10- Bring the current DNS server down and transfer its IP address to the destination DNS server.

11- On the destination DNS server, start the DNS Server service. To initiate the registration of the server's A and PTR resource records, run the following command at a command prompt:
ipconfig /registerdns

12- If this server is also a domain controller, stop and restart the Net Logon service to register the Service (SRV) records, or run the following command at a command prompt:
netdiag /fix

13- The standard zones that were previously Active Directory-integrated can be converted back to Active Directory-integrated on the replacement DNS server if it's a domain controller.

14- Verify that the SOA resource records on each zone contain the correct name for the primary server and that the NS resource records for the zone(s) are correct.
